      <p>
        Meetup is a website that allows users to organize get-togethers with
        others who enjoy the same activities. Some common examples include
        sports teams, book clubs, and social groups. By signing up, you can find
        a group that suits the activity youâ€™re looking for, or create your own
        group to bring others to you.
